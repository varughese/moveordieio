If you want to edit the looks of this already-existing character, all you have to do is edit the CharacterNameSheet.png in your image editor of choice. Make sure you change "CharacterName" into something more fitting in all the files and folder before you publish your mod.

If you want to create a new character (which implies drawing and animating a new character), you don't have to touch the files in this folder, look in the "Source Files" folder in the Character Starting Kit.

Keep being awesome,
